# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers aboard the Titanic and their survival rates. The primary goal of this analysis is to understand how various factors such as gender, age, class, and fare affected the survival rate of passengers. Visualizations are used to identify key trends and insights from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- **Survived**: Whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass**: The class of the passenger (1st, 2nd, or 3rd).
- **Name**: The name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: The gender of the passenger (male or female).
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Fare**: The fare paid for the ticket.
- **Embarked**: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).

## Installation

To run the analysis, you will need Python along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`

## Usage

To run the analysis, clone this repository and open the `titanic.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: Load and explore the Titanic dataset to understand the basic structure and statistics.
2. **Survival Rate by Gender**: Analyze survival rates for male and female passengers.
3. **Survival Rate by Class**: Explore survival rates across different passenger classes.
4. **Survival Rate by Age**: Visualize survival rates based on age distribution.
5. **Fare vs Survival Rate**: Investigate how fare paid impacted survival chances.
